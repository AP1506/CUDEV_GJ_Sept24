Repo rules:
- Never push to main, make a branch off of main and create a pull request. Please do some testing to make sure you haven't broken anything before pulling into main
- Don't modify other's files without permission. If you do, make a pull request with your changes and ask the other person to review the changes.
- For file organization, in terms of scripts and scenes you can organize things into your own files. For assets, we can have an Assets folder.
